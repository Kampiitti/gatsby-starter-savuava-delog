# One possible way to reconfigure your stress levels after quarantine

## The drive

I started driving up North to Äkäslompolo, Kolari around six in the evening. My purpose was to do a quick trip to Lapland that has had phenomenal winter with plenty of snow. Due to quarantine taking place we did not get to go there during the best snow conditions but I decided to try and ease the longing for snow by driving up now. I drove non-stop without stopping and I got there around 22:50. Right after arriving I set up my gear for the nightly hike. There was no particular reason or actual sense to attempt the hike at night time but it seemed something new and kind of special. Something I had never done before. I set my board, snowshoes and my backpack so that everything would be nicely accessible when I took my way towards the fell Lainio and Lumikuru.

## The hike

I drove over to Navettagalleria and started my way towards Kotamaja which lies approximately less than a kilometer from Lumikuru. A formation in the fell that should contain snow almost until Summer months. I had done the same trip two years ago with a friend and my fiancé only 10 days later and then almost all the snow had already melted on May 19th 2018. This time it was different as there was still snow everywhere so the six kilometer hike there would not be as simple. The path that I took could've been skied on even though they had already stopped maintaining it due to quarantine actions over a month ago.

Luckily the snow on the path was still hard and easy to walk on. The snow outside the path though was deep and sinking waist deep. During my walk the environment and nature around me was completely quiet. The sun does not completely go down at this time of year, but it was still under the horizon which made the forest bleak and dark. Wintery forest is both beautiful but it also holds the feeling of wintery and cold threat. It was dead quiet. Maybe a bird sung here and there but otherwise if you stood still the only thing you could hear was your own heart beating in your chest.

For me it was exciting as I was attempting to reach the fell that I had been dreaming of for the whole winter. But the forest also made me nervous as the rattling and rustling of my gear made me think that I heard sounds from around me but when I stopped I heard nothing. (Later I learned that some 6 kilometers away they had already seen bear tracks on the ground). Mostly if anything I was worried of a lone wolf that might be in the area and walking around, despite them being usually more interested in other animals like reindeer and such. (My mom was walking a dog some 6 years ago when a lone wolf jumped on the road and started walking towards them but fled before engaging). I presumed that there would be reindeer in the area and that any beast would be more interested in them than in me which gave me comfort in my solitude.

I kept going and it took me about 1 hour to make it close enough that I could set up my board and ride it instead of carrying. When stopping and digging for my gear I was freightened when I gazed forward and from the darkness of the forest I saw five reindeer walking on the ski path. They stopped a good distance away from me and started looking at what I was doing. As they realised that I was there on the same path they were walking on they soon fled and I was able to set up my board and take the last kilometer to Kotamaja with half of it riding on the board. Kotamaja is a wilderness ski hut behind a swamp that looks directly to three fells surrounding it. The snowy Lumikuru is directly visible to Kotamaja on fell Lainio and the other two being Aakenus and Kukas.

## The decision

I reached Kotamaja around 1:30am in the middle of the night. I stood there for approximately ten minutes to think what I would do next. As the night was still giving me some formidable feelings of uncertainty I decided not to tire myself more by attempting to ascent and snowboard Lumikuru. Instead I decided that while I’m there I might as well just see the top of Kukas. Another fell just two kilometers away that has a nice panoramic view of all the fells around it and a nice ride down.
I started my way back over the swamp and up the fell which was rooted right where the swamp ended. The path was nice to walk on and I was less afraid as I was gaining higher ground. It took me about half an hour to reach the summit. I saw the sun in the horizon where it lurked for few hours before rising back up again around 2:56. I took off my stuff and started packing my stuff more tightly for a way down. I spent fifteen minutes on top of the fell and gazed around in the quietness that was surrounding me only broken by a bird flying past twice.

I filmed a video of my surroundings before heading down. The way down was fast on the ski path and I managed to stay up even with the heavy backpack that I was carrying. The path was nice and curvy so it was a decent ride as well. After I stopped I had approximately one kilometer left for my car. I managed to clear that distance fast in approximately 25 minutes and I was at my car around 3:05. Relieved that the trip was over I was already excited about what I had achieved during this three hour trip in the nightly winter woods.

## The Analysis

I have a feeling now that since we’ve been mostly indoors for the last three months our stress level and bodies get used to the environment that surrounds us. There’s no big changes when staying in most days and going out for 1 to 2 hours per day to train or enjoy the sun. Due to this our bodies and minds start getting acclimated to this continuously growing stress and anxiety to get back to normal. If we would not do anything different we would eventually burn out or require an extensive time off in the form of holiday to really recover and maybe use some of that time to get out also.

As such I felt that my trip had enabled me to recalibrate my stress levels by exploding the threshold of physical stress that I experienced. Think about the factors that contributed to both rapidly increasing the emotional and physical stress levels:

–Night time and fatique due to long day being awake

–Heavy backpack

–Intense feeling of the dead silent nightly forest

–The bleak winter environment

–The disappointment at not reaching my initial target

–Heavy physical exercise brought in the form of hiking 12 kilometers with heavy backpack in the snow

–Cold air, it was -4 degrees Celsius during the night

Most of these contribute to an increased feeling of stress. After returning home and recovering from this type of stress I would claim that it has made an effect on the initial stress that I was carrying even though I wasn’t actually resting and attempting to recover. On top of this it has been researched that spending time in the forest has the ability to lower your blood pressure and stress levels just by being in the forest.

To conclude this story and my deductions I would state that getting out would do good for most people after this extended period of being indoors. It can recalibrate the stress levels faster than time and I would call this life-hacking or biohacking of a type. Just remember to be safe and understand your limits and recover well enough after attempting anything similar to this.
