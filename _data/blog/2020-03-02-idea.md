metaDescription: from idea to practice to purpose

What I have learned during the years that is it not until you bring your ideas into practice you see whether they are meant to succeed.

Success of an idea can be defined in two distinct ways:
Your idea either entertaines or inspires.

This page and savuava is meant to inspire and entertain, depending on your type of personality and interests.
